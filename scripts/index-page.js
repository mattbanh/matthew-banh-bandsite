// You must have an array in JavaScript with 3 default comment objects to start. Comments must have a name, a timestamp, and the comment text.
// You must have a function called displayComment() that takes in one comment object as a parameter and displays it on the page using JavaScript DOM manipulation.
// No template literals should be used. All dynamic HTML should be added to DOM via DOM Methods for individual elements. Avoid bulk assigning stringified HTML using innerHTML
