# matthew-banh-bandsite

BandSite is a project for week 3-5 of the web development bootcamp. Sprint 1 is meant to provide practice for HTML and CSS concepts learned during week 1-2. I followed a pdf mockup and style guide, prioritizing the mockup to create the website. I followed the functional, visual, and implementation requirements provided with a focus on responsiveness, BEM naming, and Sass.
